            <p>With his editorial designs, advertisements, and visual identity works, Rand brought avant-garde European ideas to the United-States, mixing visual arts and commercial design. His colourful combinations, approach of typography and use of media translate his desire to "defamiliarize the ordinary".</p>
            <p>Rand first made his mark in the 1930s with a bold and modernist style, designing magazine and book covers a few years later.</p>
            <p>From 1955, he distinguished himself as a progressive figure serving the interests of the company. As an art director, he helped transform the advertising industry by emphasizing the importance of graphic design and visual effects to words. He designed logos for big companies like IBM, ABC, UPS or Steve Jobs' NeXT.</p>
